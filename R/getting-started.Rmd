# Getting Started 

## Why R?
The R programming language was not created by software engineers for software development like C or Java. Instead, it was developed by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis. You can read the full history [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9b48/46f192aa37ca122cfabb1ed1b59866d8bfda.pdf). The interactivity is an indispensable feature in data science because, as you will soon learn, the ability to quickly explore data is a necessity for success in this field. However, like in other programming languages, you can save your work as scripts that can be easily executed at any moment. These scripts serve as a record of the analysis you performed, a key feature that facilitates reproducible work. If you are an expert programmer, you should not expect R to follow the conventions you are used to since you will be disappointed. If you are patient, you will come to appreciate the unequal power of R when it comes to data analysis and, specifically, data visualization.

Other attractive features of R are the following:

1. R is free and [open source](https://opensource.org/history).
2. It runs across all major platforms: Windows, Mac Os, UNIX/Linux.
3. Scripts and data objects can be shared seamlessly across platforms.
4. There is a large, growing, and active community of R users and, as a result, there are numerous resources for [learning](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/138/free-resources-for-learning-r) and [asking](https://www.r-project.org/help.html) [questions](https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/r/topics). 
5. It easy for others to contribute add-ons which enables developers to share software implementations of new data science methodologies. This gives R users early access to the latest methods and to tools which are developed for a wide variety of disciplines, including ecology, molecular biology, social sciences and geography, just to name a few examples. 


## Installing R

You can download R freely from
the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)
(CRAN). It is relatively straightforward, but if you need further help
you can try the following resources:

* [Installing R on Windows](https://github.com/genomicsclass/windows#installing-r)
* [Installing R on Mac](http://youtu.be/Icawuhf0Yqo)
* [Installing R on Ubuntu](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README)

If you want to try out R without installing it, you can access a web based console such as [R fiddle](http://www.r-fiddle.org/#/).

## The R console

Interactive data analysis usually occurs on the _R console_ that executes commands as you type them. There are several ways to gain access to an R console. One way is to simply start R on your computer. The console looks something like this:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
## http://ww2.coastal.edu/kingw/statistics/R-tutorials/install_help/R_console.png
knitr::include_graphics("img/R_console.png")
```

As a quick example, try using the console to calculate a 15% tip on a meal that cost $19.71:

```{r, tip_calculator}
0.15 * 19.71  
```

Note that in this book, grey boxes are used to show R code typed into the R console. The symbol `#>` is used to denote what the R console outputs.

## Scripts

One of the great advantages of R over point-and-click analysis software is that you can save your work as scripts. You can edit and save these scripts using a text editor. We highly recommend working on an interactive _integrated development environment_ (IDE) such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). RStudio includes an editor with many R specific features, a console to execute your code, and other useful panes, including one to show figures.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio.png")
```

Most web-based R consoles also provide a pane to edit scripts, but not all permit you to save the scripts for later use.


## Installing RStudio

Instructions on how to install RStudio are
[here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Special instructions for Windows users are [here](https://github.com/genomicsclass/windows).

Once you install RStudio, you can simply start RStudio rather than R since that program automatically starts R. But don't be confused: R and RStudio are different pieces of software and you can't run RStudio without first installing R.

If you are going to follow along with RStudio as you read this book, you might consider reading the chapter five sections specifically dedicated to RStudio. Besides a script editor, RStudio includes many useful features and you want to familiarize yourself with these.

And remember the R scripts used to generate this book can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/rafalab/dsbook).

## The R ecosystem

The functionality provided by a fresh install of R is only a small fraction of what is possible. In fact, we refer to what you get after your first install as _base R_. The extra functionality comes from add-ons available from developers. There are currently hundreds of these available from CRAN and many others shared via other repositories such as GitHub. However, because not everybody needs all available functionality, we instead make different components available via _packages_. R makes it very easy to install packages from within R. For example, to install the `dslabs` package which we use to share datasets and code related to this book, you would type:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dslabs")
```

In RStudio, you can navigate to the _Tools_ tab and select install packages. We can then load the package into our R sessions using the `library` function:

```{r}
library(dslabs)
```

As you go through this book, you will see that we load packages without installing them. This is because once you install a package, it remains installed and only needs to be loaded with `library`. The package remains loaded until we quit the R session. If you try to load a package and get an error, it probably means you need to install it first.
