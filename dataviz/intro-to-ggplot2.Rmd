# ggplot2

We have now described several data visualization techniques and are ready to learn how to create them in R. Throughout the book, we will be using the __[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org)__ package. We can load it, along with __dplyr__, as part of the tidyverse:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Many other approaches are available for creating plots in R. In fact, the plotting capabilities that come with a basic installation of R are already quite powerful. We have seen examples of these already with the functions `plot`, `hist` and `boxplot`. There are also other packages for creating graphics such as __grid__ and __lattice__. We chose to use __ggplot2__ in this book because it breaks plots into components in a way that permits beginners to create relatively complex and aesthetically pleasing plots using syntax that is intuitive and comparatively easy to remember. 

One reason __ggplot2__ is generally more intuitive for beginners is that it uses a [grammar of graphics](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447), the _gg_ in __ggplot2__. This is analogous to the way learning grammar can help a beginner construct hundreds of different sentences by learning just a handful of verbs, nouns and adjectives without having to memorize each specific sentence. Similarly, by learning a handful of __ggplot2__ building blocks and its grammar, you will be able to create hundreds of different plots. 

Another reason __ggplot2__ makes it easier for beginners is that its default behavior is carefully chosen to satisfy the great majority of cases and is visually pleasing. As a result, it is possible to create informative and elegant graphs with relatively simple and readable code.

One limitation is that __ggplot2__ is designed to work exclusively with data tables in which rows are observations and columns are variables. However, a substantial percentage of datasets that beginners work with are, or can be converted into, this format. An advantage of this approach is that, assuming that our data follows this format, it simplifies the code and learning the grammar. 

## The cheat sheet

To use __ggplot2__  you will have to learn several functions and arguments. These are hard to memorize so we highly recommend you have the a [ggplot2 sheet cheat](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) handy. You can get a copy here: [https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) or simply perform an internet search for "ggplot2 cheat sheet".

## The components of a graph

We construct a graph that summarizes the US murders dataset:

```{r ggplot-example-plot, echo=FALSE}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)

r <- murders %>% 
  summarize(pop=sum(population), tot=sum(total)) %>% 
  mutate(rate = tot/pop*10^6) %>% .$rate

murders %>% ggplot(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total, label = abb)) +  
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty=2, col="darkgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(color=region), size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010") +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Region") +
  theme_economist()
```

We can clearly see how much states vary across population size and the total number of murders. Not surprisingly, we also see a clear relationship between murder totals and population size. A state falling on the dashed grey line has the same murder rate as the US average. The four geographic regions are denoted with color which depicts how most southern states have murder rates above the average. 

This data visualization shows us pretty much all the information in the data table. The code needed to make this plot is relatively simple. We will learn to create the plot part by part. 

The first step in learning __ggplot2__ is to be able to break a graph apart into components. Let's break down the plot above and introduce some of the __ggplot2__ terminology. The main three components to note are:
 
1. __Data__: The US murders data table is being summarized. We refer to this as the __data__ component. 
2. __Geometry__: The plot above is a scatterplot. This is referred to as the 
__geometry__ component. Other possible geometries are barplot, histograms, smooth densities, qqplots, and boxplots. 
3. __Aesthetic mapping__: The x-axis values are used to display population size, the y-axis values are used to display the total number of murders, text is used to identify the states, and colors are used to denote the four different regions. These are the __aesthetic mappings__ component. How we define the mapping depends on what __geometry__ we are using. 

We also note that:

4. The range of the x-axis and y-axis appears to be defined by the range of the data. They are both on log-scales. We refer to this as the 
__scale__ component. 
5. There are labels, a title, a legend, and we use the style of The Economist magazine.

We will now construct the plot piece by piece. We start by loading the dataset:

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

## `ggplot` objects: a blank slate 

The first step in creating a __ggplot2__ graph is to define a `ggplot` object. We do this with the function `ggplot` which initializes the graph. If we read the help file for this function, we see that the first argument is used to specify what data is associated with this object: 


```{r ggplot-example-1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = murders)
```

We can also pipe the data. So this line of code is equivalent to the one above:
```{r ggplot-example-2}
murders %>% ggplot()
```

It renders a plot, in this case a blank slate, since no geometry has been defined. The only style choice we see is a grey background.

What has happened above is that the object was created and, because it was not assigned, it was automatically evaluated. But we can define an object, for example, like this:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = murders)
class(p)
```

To render the plot associated with this object, we simply print the object `p`. The following two lines of code produce the same plot we see above:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(p)
p
```

## Geometries

In ggplot we create graphs by adding _layers_. Layers can define geometries, compute summary statistics, define what scales to use, or even change styles.
To add layers, we use the the symbol `+`. In general, a line of code will look like this:

>> DATA %>% `ggplot()` + LAYER 1 + LAYER 2 + ... + LAYER N

Usually, the first added layer defines the geometry. We want to make a scatterplot. So what geometry do we use?

Taking a quick look at the cheat sheet, we see that the function used to create plots with this geometry is `geom_point`. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##https://ugoproto.github.io/ugo_r_doc/img/visualization_cs/ggplot2-cheatsheeta.png
knitr::include_graphics("dataviz/img/ggplot2-cheatsheeta.png")
```

(Source: [RStudio](https://ugoproto.github.io/ugo_r_doc/img/visualization_cs/ggplot2-cheatsheeta.png))

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##https://ugoproto.github.io/ugo_r_doc/img/visualization_cs/ggplot2-cheatsheetb.png
knitr::include_graphics("dataviz/img/ggplot2-cheatsheetb.png")
```

(Source: [RStudio](https://ugoproto.github.io/ugo_r_doc/img/visualization_cs/ggplot2-cheatsheeta.png))


Geometry function names follow this pattern: `geom` and the name of the geometry connected by an underscore. 

For `geom_point` to know what to do, we need to provide data and a mapping. We have already connected the object `p` with the `murders` data table and, if we add as a layer `geom_point`, we will default to using this data. To find out what mappings are expected, we read the __Aesthetics__ section of the help file `geom_point` help file:

> Aesthetics
> 
> geom_point understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):
>
> x
>
> y
> 
> alpha
>
> colour


and, as expected, we see that at least two arguments are required `x` and `y`. 
 
## Aesthetic mappings
 
`aes` will be one of the functions you will most use. This function connects data with what we see on the graph. We refer to this connect as the __aesthetic mappings__. The outcome of this function is often used as the argument of a geometry function. This example produces a scatterplot of total murders versus population in millions:
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
murders %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total))
```
 
We can drop the `x = ` and `y =` if we wanted to since these are the first and second expected arguments, as seen in the help page. 

We can also add a layer to the `p` object that has defined above as `p <- ggplot(data = murders)`:

```{r ggplot-example-3}
p + geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total))
```


The scale and labels are defined by default when adding this layer. We also use the variable names from the object component: `population` and `total`. 

The behavior of recognizing the variables from the data component is quite specific to `aes`. With most functions, if you try to access the values of `population` or `total` outside of `aes` you receive an error. 


## Layers

A second layer in the plot we wish to make involves adding a label to each point to identify the state. The `geom_label` and `geom_text` functions permit us to add text to the plot with and without a rectangle behind the text respectively.

Because each state (each point) has a label, we need an aesthetic mapping to make the connection. By reading the help file, we learn that we supply the mapping between point and label through the `label` argument of `aes`.  So the code looks like this:


```{r  ggplot-example-4}
p + geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total)) +
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
```

We have successfully added a second layer to the plot. 

As an example of the unique behavior of `aes` mentioned above, note that this call: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p_test <- p + geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
```

is fine, whereas this call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p_test <- p + geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total), label = abb) 
```

will give you an error since `abb` is not found once it is outside of the `aes` function. The layer `geom_text` does not know where to find `abb` since it is not a global variable.

## Tinkering with arguments
 
Each geometry function has many arguments other than `aes` and `data`. They tend to be specific to the function. For example, in the plot we wish to make, the points are larger than the default ones. In the help file we see that `size` is an aesthetic and we can change it like this:


```{r ggplot-example-5}
p + geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total), size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
```

`size` is __not__ a mapping, it affects all the points so we do not need to include it inside `aes`.

Now that the points are larger, it is hard to see the labels. If we read the help file for `geom_text`, we see the `nudge_x` argument, which moves the text slightly to the right:

```{r ggplot-example-6}
p + geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total), size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb), nudge_x = 1)
```

This is preferred as it makes it easier to read the text.

## Global versus local aesthetic mappings

In the previous line of code, we define the mapping `aes(population/10^6, total)` twice, once in each geometry. We can avoid this by using a _global_ aesthetic mapping. We can do this when we define the blank slate `ggplot` object. Remember that the function `ggplot` contains an argument that permits us to define aesthetic mappings:

```{r}
args(ggplot)
```

If we define a mapping in `ggplot`, then all the geometries that are added as layers will default to this mapping. We redefine `p`:

```{r}
p <- murders %>% ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb))
```

and then we can simply use code as follows:

```{r ggplot-example-7}
p + geom_point(size = 3) + 
  geom_text(nudge_x = 1.5)
```

We keep the `size` and `nudge_x` argument in `geom_point` and `geom_text` respectively because we want to only increase the size of points and only nudge the labels. Also, note that the `geom_point` function does not need a `label` argument and therefore ignores it.

If necessary, we can override the global mapping by defining a new mapping within each layer. These _local_ definitions override the _global_. Here is an example:

```{r ggplot-example-8}
p + geom_point(size = 3) +  
  geom_text(aes(x = 10, y = 800, label = "Hello there!"))
```

Clearly, the second call to `geom_text` does not use the `population` and `total`.


## Scales

First, our desired scales are in log-scale. This is not the default so this change needs to be added through a _scales_ layer. A quick look at the cheat sheet reveals the `scale_x_continuous` lets us control the behavior of scales. We use them like this: 


```{r ggplot-example-9}
p + geom_point(size = 3) +  
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10") 
```

Because we are in the log-scale now, the _nudge_ must be made smaller.

This particular transformation is so common that __ggplot2__ provides specialized functions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p + geom_point(size = 3) +  
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() 
```


## Labels and titles

Similarly, the cheat sheet quickly reveals that to change labels and add a title, we use the following functions:

```{r ggplot-example-10}
p + geom_point(size = 3) +  
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010")
```

We are almost there! All we have left to do is add color, a legend and optional changes to the style.

## Categories as colors

We can change the color of the points using the `col` argument in the `geom_point` function. To facilitate exposition, we will redefine `p` to be everything except the points layer:

```{r}
p <-  murders %>% ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb)) +   
  geom_text(nudge_x = 0.05) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010")
```

and then test out what happens by adding different calls to `geom_point`. We can make all the points blue by adding the `color` argument:

```{r ggplot-example-11}
p + geom_point(size = 3, color ="blue")
```

This, of course, is not what we want. We want to assign color depending on the geographical region. A nice default behavior of __ggplot2__ is that if we assign a categorical variable to color, it automatically assigns a different color to each category. It also adds a legend! 

To map each point to a color, we need to use `aes` since this is a mapping. We use the following code:

```{r ggplot-example-12}
p + geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 3)
```

The `x` and `y` mappings are inherited from those already defined in `p`. So we do not redefine them. We also move `aes` to the first argument since that is where the mappings are expected in this call.

Here we see yet another useful default behavior: __ggplot2__ has automatically added a legend that maps color to region. 

## Annotation and shapes

We often want to add shapes or annotation to figures that are not derived directly from the aesthetic mapping; examples include labels, boxes, shaded areas and lines.

Here we want to add a line that represents the average murder rate for the entire country. Once we determine the per million rate to be $r$, this line is defined by the formula: $y = r x$, with $y$ and $x$ our axes: total murders and population in millions respectively. In the log-scale this line turns into: $\log(y) = \log(r) + \log(x)$. So in our plot it's a line with slope 1 and intercept $\log(r)$. To compute this value, we use our __dplyr__ skills:

```{r}
r <- murders %>% 
  summarize(rate = sum(total) /  sum(population) * 10^6) %>% .$rate
```

To add a line we use the `geom_abline` function. __ggplot2__ uses `ab` in the name to remind us we are supplying the intercept (`a`) and slope (`b`). The default line has slope 1 and intercept 0 so we only have to define the intercept:

```{r ggplot-example-13}
p + geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 3) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r))
```

Here `geom_abline` does not use any information from the data object.

We can change the line type and color of the lines using arguments. Also, we draw it first so it doesn't go over our points. 

```{r}
p <- p + geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty = 2, color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 3)  
```
Note that we redefined `p`.

## Adjustments 

The default plots created by __ggplot2__ are already very useful. However, we frequently need to make minor tweaks to the default behavior. Although it is not always obvious how to make these even with the cheat sheet, __ggplot2__ is very flexible.

For example, we can make changes to the legend via the `scale_color_discrete` function. In our plot the word _region_ is capitalized and we can change it like this:

```{r}
p <- p + scale_color_discrete(name = "Region") 
```

## Add-on packages

The power of __ggplot2__ is augmented further due to the availability of add-on packages.
The remaining changes needed to put the finishing touches on our plot require the __ggthemes__ and __ggrepel__ packages.

The style of a __ggplot2__ graph can be changed using the `theme` functions. Several themes are included as part of the __ggplot2__ package. In fact, for most of the plots in this book, we use a function in the __dslabs__ package that automatically sets a default theme:

```{r, eval}
ds_theme_set()
```

Many other themes are added by the package __ggthemes__. Among those are the `theme_economist` theme that we used. After installing the package, you can change the style by adding a layer like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggthemes)
p + theme_economist()
```

You can see how some of the other themes look by simply changing the function. For instance, you might try the `theme_fivethirtyeight()` theme instead.

The final difference has to do with the position of the labels. In our plot, some of the labels fall on top of each other. The add-on package __ggrepel__ includes a geometry that adds labels while ensuring that they don't fall on top of each other. We simply change `geom_text` with `geom_text_repel`.

## Putting it all together

Now that we are done testing, we can write one piece of code that produces our desired plot from scratch. 


```{r final-ggplot-example}
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)

### First define the slope of the line
r <- murders %>% 
  summarize(rate = sum(total) /  sum(population) * 10^6) %>% .$rate

## Now make the plot
murders %>% ggplot(aes(population/10^6, total, label = abb)) +   
  geom_abline(intercept = log10(r), lty = 2, color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_point(aes(col=region), size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel() + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Populations in millions (log scale)") + 
  ylab("Total number of murders (log scale)") +
  ggtitle("US Gun Murders in 2010") + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Region") +
  theme_economist()
```

## Other geometries

Now let's try to make the summary plots we have described in this chapter.

### Histogram {-}

Let's start with the histogram. First, we need to use __dplyr__ to filter the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
heights %>% filter(sex=="Male")
```

Once we have a dataset, the next step is deciding what geometry we need. If you guessed `geom_histogram`, you guessed correctly. By looking at the help file for this function, we learn that the only required argument is `x`, the variable for which we will construct a histogram. The code looks like this:

```{r ggplot-histogram}
p <- heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) 

p + geom_histogram()
```

As before, we can drop the `x =`.

This call gives us a message:

> `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with
`binwidth`.
 
We previously used a bin size of 1 inch, so the code looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

Finally, if for aesthetic reasons we want to add color, we use the arguments described in the help file. We also add labels and a title:

```{r height-histogram-rep, echo=FALSE}
p + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", col = "black") +
  xlab("Male heights in inches") + 
  ggtitle("Histogram")
```

### Density {-}

To create a smooth density, we need a different geometry: we used `geom_density` instead. 

```{r ggplot-density}
p + geom_density()
```

To fill in with color, we can use the `fill` argument.

```{r ggplot-density-with-fill}
p + geom_density(fill="blue")
```


### QQ-plots {-}

For qq-plots we use the `geom_qq` geometry. From the help file, we learn that we need to specify the `sample` (we will learn about samples in a later chapter). 

```{r ggplot-qq}
p <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = height)) 
p + geom_qq()
```

By default, the sample variable is compared to a normal distribution with average 0 and standard deviation 1. To change this, again from the help file, we use the `dparams` arguments. 

```{r  ggplot-qq-dparams}
params <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(height), sd = sd(height))

p  +  geom_qq(dparams = params)
```

Adding an identity line is as simple as assigning another layer. For straight lines, we use the `geom_abline` function. To help you remember the name of this function, remember that the `ab` in front of `line` serves to remind us that we need to supply an intercept (a) and slope (b) to draw the line $y=a+bx$. The default is the identity `a=0` and `b=1`.

```{r ggplot-qq-with-line}
p +  geom_qq(dparams = params) + 
  geom_abline()
```

Another option here is to scale the data first and then make a qqplot against the standard normal:

```{r ggplot-qq-standard-units}
heights %>% 
  filter(sex=="Male") %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = scale(height))) + 
  geom_qq() +
  geom_abline()
```


## Grids of plots

There are often reasons to graph plots next to each other. The __gridExtra__ package permits us to do that:

```{r}
p <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% ggplot(aes(x = height)) 
p1 <- p + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", col="black")
p2 <- p + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "blue", col="black")
p3 <- p + geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, fill = "blue", col="black")
```

To print them all side-by-side, we can use the function `grid.arrange` in the __gridExtra__ package:

```{r gridextra-example,  out.width='100%'}
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3, ncol = 3)
```

## Quick plots with `qplot`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

We have learned the powerful approach to generating visualization with ggplot. However, there are instances in which all we want is to make a quick plot of, for example, a histogram of the values in a vector, a scatter plot of the values in two vectors, or a boxplot using categorical and numeric vectors. We demonstrated how to generate these plots with `hist`, `plot`, and `boxplot`. However, if we want to keep consistent with the ggplot style, we can use the function `qplot`.

So if we have values in a vector, say:

```{r}
x <- murders$population
```

and we want to make a histogram with ggplot, we would have to type something like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data.frame(x = x) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=15)
```

Using R-base it is much quicker:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hist(x)
```

However, using `qplot` we can generate a plot using the ggplot style just as quickly:

```{r qplot-example-1}
qplot(x, bins=15)
```

Looking at the help file for the `qplot` function, we see several ways in which we can improve the look of the plot:

```{r qplot-example-2}
qplot(x, bins=15, color = I("black"), xlab = "Population")
```

The reason we use `I("black")` is because we want `qplot` to treat `"black"` as a character rather than convert it to a factor, which is the default behavior within `aes`, which is internally called here. In general, the function `I` is used in R to say "keep it as it is!".

One convenient feature of `qplot` is that it guesses what plot we want. For example, if we call it with two variables we get a scatterplot

```{r qplot-example-3}
y <- murders$total
qplot(x, y)
```

and if the first argument is a factor we get a points plot like this:

```{r qplot-example-4}
f <- murders$region
qplot(f, y)
```

We can also explicitly ask for a geometry using the `geom` argument:

```{r qplot-example-5}
qplot(f, y, geom = "boxplot")
```

We can also explicitly tell `qplot` what dataset to use:

```{r qplot-example-6}
qplot(population, total, data = murders)
```


## Exercises {-}


Start by loading the tidyverse or ggplot2 library as well as the `murders` and `heights` data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
data(murders)
```

1. With ggplot2 plots can be saved as objects. For example we can associate a dataset with a plot object like this

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    p <- ggplot(data = murders)
    ```

    Because `data` is the first argument we don't need to spell it out

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    p <- ggplot(murders)
    ```

    and we can also use the pipe:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    p <- murders %>% ggplot()
    ```

    What is class of the object `p`?

 
2. Remember that to print an object you can use the command `print` or simply type the object. For example

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    x <- 2
    x
    print(x)
    ```

    Print the object `p` defined in exercise one and describe what you see.

    A. Nothing happens

    B. A blank slate plot
    
    C. A scatter plot
    
    D. A histogram

   
3. Using the pipe `%>%`, create an object `p` but this time associated with the `heights` dataset instead of the `murders` dataset. 

   

4. What is the class of the object `p` you have just created?

   
5. Now we are going to add a layers and the corresponding aesthetic mappings. For the murders data we plotted total murders versus population sizes. Explore the `murders` data frame to remind yourself what are the names for these two variables and select the correct answer. __Hint__: Look at `?murders`.


    A. `state` and `abb`

    B. `total_murers` and `population_size`
    
    C.  `total` and `population`

    D. `murders` and `size`


6. To create the scatter plot we add a layer with `geom_point`. The aesthetic mappings require us to define the x-axis and y-axis variables respectively. So the code looks like this:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    murders %>% ggplot(aes(x = , y = )) +
      geom_point()
    ```

    except we have to define the two variables `x` and `y`. Fill this out with the correct variable names.


7. Note that if we don't use argument names, we can obtain the same plot by making sure we enter the variable names in the right order like this:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    murders %>% ggplot(aes(population, total)) +
      geom_point()
    ```

    Remake the plot but now with total in the x-axis and population in the y-axis.


8. If instead of points we want to add text, we can use the `geom_text()` or `geom_label()` geometries. The following code 

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    murders %>% ggplot(aes(population, total)) +
      geom_label()
    ```
    
    will give us the error message: `Error: geom_label requires the following missing aesthetics: label`

    Why is this?

    A. We need to map a character to each point through the label argument in aes

    B. We need to let `geom_label` know what character to use in the plot
  
    C. The `geom_label` geometry does not require  x-axis and y-axis values.
    
    D. `geom_label` is not a ggplot2 command


9. Rewrite the code above to  abbreviation as the label through `aes`


10. Now let's change the color of the labels through blue. How will we do this?

    A. Adding a column called `blue` to `murders`
  
    B. Because each label needs a different color we map the colors through `aes`

    C. Use the `color` argument in `ggplot`

    D. Because we want all colors to be blue, we do not need to map colors, just use the color argument in `geom_label`


11. Rewrite the code above to make the labels blue


12. Now suppose we want to use color to represent the different regions. In this case which of the following is most appropriate:

    A. Adding a column called `color` to `murders` with the color we want to use.
    
    B. Because each label needs a different color we map the colors through the color argument of `aes` .

    C. Use the `color` argument in `ggplot`
    
    D. Because we want all colors to be blue, we do not need to map colors, just use the color argument in `geom_label`


11. Rewrite the code above to make the labels' color be determined by the state's region.

12. Now we are going to change the x-axis to a log scale to account for the fact the distribution of population is skewed. Let's start by define an object `p` holding the plot we have made up to now

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    p <- murders %>% ggplot(aes(population, total, label = abb, color = region)) +
      geom_label() 
    ```

    To change the y-axis to a log scale we learned about the `scale_x_log10()` function. Add this layer to the object `p` to change the scale and render the plot


13. Repeat the previous exercise but now change both axes to be in the log scale

14. Now edit the code above to add the title "Gun murder data" to the plot. Hint: use the `ggtitle` function.


15. Now we are going to use the `geom_histogram` function to make a histogram of the heights in the `height` data frame. When reading the documentation for this function we see that it requires just one mapping, the values to be used for the histogram. Make a histogram of all the plots. 

    What is the variable containing the heights?

    A. `sex`
  
    B. `heights`
    
    C. `height`

    D. `heights$height`

16. Now create a ggplot object using the pipe to assign the heights data to a ggplot object an assign `height` to the x values through the `aes` function

17. Now we are ready to add a layer to actually make the histogram. Use the object `p` you have just created and the `geom_histogram` function to make the histogram

18. Note that when we run the code in the previous exercise we get the warning:
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.`

    Use the `binwidth` argument to change the histogram made in the previous exercise to use bins of size 1 inch. 

19. Now instead of histogram we are going to make a smooth density plot. In this case we will not make a object. instead we will render the plot with one line of code. Change the code previous used

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    heights %>% 
      ggplot(aes(height)) +
      geom_histogram()
    ```

    to make a smooth density instead of a histogram.


20. Now we are going to make a density plot for males and females separately. We can do this using any of the following arguments group. We do this through the aesthetic mapping as each point need to be assigned the calculation of a density.

22. We can also assign groups through the `color` argument. This has the added benefit that it uses color to distinguish the groups. Change the code above to use color

23. We can also assign groups through the `fill` argument. This has the added benefit that it uses color to distinguish the groups. Like this:


    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    heights %>% 
      ggplot(aes(height, fill = sex)) + 
      geom_density() 
    ```

    However, here the second density is drawn over the other. We can change this by using alpha blending. Set the alpha parameter to 0.2 in the geom_density function to make this change.
