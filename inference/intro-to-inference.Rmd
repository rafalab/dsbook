# (PART) Inference and modeling {-}

The day before the 2008 presidential election, Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight stated that "Barack Obama appears poised for a decisive electoral victory". They went further and predicted that Obama would win the election with 349 electoral votes to 189, and the popular vote by a margin of 6.1%. FiveThirtyEight also attached a probabilistic statement to their prediction claiming that Obama had a 91% chance of winning the election. The predictions were quite accurate since, in the final results, Obama won the electoral college 365 to 173 and the popular vote by a 7.2% difference. Their performance in the 2008 election brought FiveThirtyEight to the attention of political pundits and TV personalities. The week before the 2012, FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver was giving Obama a 90% chance of winning despite many of the experts thinking the final results would be closer. Political commentator Joe Scarborough said [during his show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbKkjm-gheY):

>>Anybody that thinks that this race is anything but a tossup right now is such an ideologue ... they're jokes. 

To which Nate Silver responded via Twitter:

>> If you think it's a toss-up, let's bet. If Obama wins, you donate $1,000 to the American Red Cross. If Romney wins, I do. Deal?

How was Mr. Silver so confident? We will demonstrate how _poll aggregators_, such as FiveThirtyEight, collected and combined data reported by different experts to produce improved predictions. The two main statistical tools used by the aggregators are the topic of this chapter: inference and modeling. To begin to understand how election forecasting works, we need to understand the basic data point they use: poll results.


Opinion polling has been conducted since the 19th century. The general goal of these is to describe the opinions held by a specific population on a given set of topics. In recent times, these polls have been pervasive during presidential elections. Polls are useful when interviewing every member of a particular population is logistically impossible. The general strategy is to interview a smaller group, chosen at random, and then infer the opinions of the entire population from the opinions of the smaller group. Statistical theory is used to justify the process. This theory is referred to as  _inference_ and it is the main topic of this chapter.
