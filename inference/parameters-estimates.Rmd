# Polls

##  Opinion polls

Perhaps the best known opinion polls are those conducted to determine which candidate is preferred by voters in a given election. Political strategists make extensive use of polls to decide, among other things, how to invest resources. For example, they may want to know which geographical locations to focus their 'get out the vote' efforts. 

Elections are a particularly interesting case of opinion polls because the actual opinion of the entire population is revealed on election day. Of course, it costs millions of dollars to run an actual election which makes polling a cost effective strategy for those that want to forecast the results. 

Although typically the results of these polls are kept private, similar polls are conducted by news organizations because results tend to be of interest to the general public and, therefore, are often made public. We will eventually be looking at such data.

[Real Clear Politics](http://www.realclearpolitics.com) is an example of a news aggregator that organizes and publishes poll results. For example, [here](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html) are examples of polls reporting estimates of the popular vote for the 2016 presidential election:

Although in the United States the popular vote does not determine the result of the presidential election, we will use it as an illustrative and simple example of how well polls work. Forecasting the election is a more complex process since it involves combining results from 50 states and DC.

Let's make some observations about the table above. First, note that different polls, all taken days before the election, report a different _spread_:  the estimated difference between support for the two candidates. Notice also that the reported spreads hover around what ended up being the actual result: Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1%. We also see a column titled **MoE** which stands for _margin of error_. 

In this section, we will show how the probability concepts we learned in the previous chapter can be applied to develop the statistical approaches that make polls an effective tool. We will learn the statistical concepts necessary to define _estimates_ and _margins of errors_, and show how we can use these to forecast final results relatively well and also provide an estimate of the precision of our forecast. Once we learn this, we will be able to understand two concepts that are ubiquitous in data science: _confidence intervals_ and _p-values_. Finally, to understand probabilistic statements about the probability of a candidate winning, we will have to learn about Bayesian modelling. In the final sections, we put it all together to recreate the simplified version of the FiveThirtyEight model and apply it to the 2016 election. 

We start by connecting probability theory to the task of using polls to learn about a population.


## The sampling model for polls

To help us understand the connection between polls and what we have learned, let's construct a similar situation to the one pollsters face. We will use an urn instead of voters and, rather than competing with other pollsters for media attention, we will have a competition with a \$25 dollar prize. The challenge is to guess the spread between the proportion of blue and red beads in this urn (in this case, a pickle jar):


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="3in"}
knitr::include_graphics("inference/img/urn.jpg")
```

Before making a prediction, you can take a sample (with replacement) from the urn. To mimic the fact that running polls is expensive, it cost you \$0.10 per each bead you sample. Therefore, if your sample size is 250, and you win, you will break even since you will pay me \$25 to collect your \$25 prize. Your entry into the competition can be an interval. If the interval you submit contains the true proportion, you get half what you paid and pass to the second phase of the competition. In the second phase, the entry with the smallest interval is selected as the winner. 

The __dslabs__ package includes a function that shows a random draw from this urn:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
```

```{r first-simulated-poll, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
ds_theme_set()
take_poll(25)
```

Think about how you would construct your interval based on the data shown above. 

We have just described a simple sampling model for opinion polls. The beads inside the urn represent the individuals that will vote on election day. Those that will vote for the Republican candidate are represented with red beads and the Democrats with the blue beads. For simplicity, assume there are no other colors; that is, that there are just two parties. 

# Populations, samples, parameters and estimates

We want to predict the proportion of blue beads in the urn. Let's call this quantity $p$, which then tells us the proportion of red beads $1-p$, and the spread $p - (1-p)$, which simplifies to $2p - 1$. 

In statistical textbooks, the beads in the urn are called the _population_. The proportion of blue beads in the population $p$  is called a _parameter_. The 25 beads we see in the previous plot are called a _sample_. The task of statistical inference is to predict the parameter $p$ using the observed data in the sample. 

Can we do this with the 25 observations above? It is certainly informative. For example, given that we see 13 red and 12 blue beads, it is unlikely that $p$ > .9 or $p$ < .1. But are we ready to predict with certainty that there are more red beads than blue?  

We want to construct an estimate of $p$ using only the information we observe. An estimate can be thought of as a summary of the observed data that we think is informative about the parameter of interest. It seems intuitive to think that the proportion of blue beads in the sample $0.48$ must be at least related to the actual proportion $p$. But do we simply predict $p$ to be 0.48? First, remember that the sample proportion is a random variable. If we run the command `take_poll(25)` four times:

```{r four-simulated-polls, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar = c(3, 1, 3, 0), mgp = c(1.5, 0.5, 0)) 
take_poll(25); take_poll(25); take_poll(25); take_poll(25)
```

we get a different answer each time since the sample proportion is a random variable. 
 
Note that in the four random samples shown above, the sample proportions range from 0.44 to 0.60. By describing the distribution of this random variable, we will be able to gain insights into how good this estimate is and how we can make it better.

## The sample average

Conducting an opinion poll is being modeled as taking a random sample from an urn. We are proposing the use of the proportion of blue beads in our sample as an _estimate_ of the parameter $p$. Once we have this estimate, we can can easily report an estimate for the spread $2p-1$, but for simplicity we will illustrate the concepts for estimating $p$. We will use our knowledge of probability to defend our use of the sample proportion and quantify how close we think it is from the population proportion $p$.

We start by defining the random variable $X=1$ if we pick a blue bead at random and $0$ if it is red. This implies that the population is a list of 0s and 1s. If we sample $N$ beads, then the average of the draws $X_1, \dots, X_N$ is equivalent to the proportion of blue beads in our sample. This is because adding the $X$s is equivalent to counting the blue beads and dividing this count by the total $N$ is equivalent to computing a proportion. We use the symbol $\bar{X}$ to represent this average. In general, in statistics textbooks a bar on top of a symbol means the average.

The theory we just learned about the sum of draws becomes useful because if we know the distribution of the sum $N \bar{X}$, we know the distribution of the average $\bar{X}$ because $N$ is a non-random constant. 

For simplicity, let's assume that the draws are independent: after we see each sampled bead, we return it to the urn. In this case, what do we know about the distribution of the sum of draws? First, we know that the expected value of the sum of draws is $N$ times the average of the values in the urn. We know that the average of the 0s and 1s in the urn must be $p$, the proportion of blue beads.

Here we encounter an important difference with what we did in the Probability chapter: we don't know what is in the urn. We know there are blue and red beads, but we don't know how many of each. This is what we want to find out: we are trying to **estimate** $p$. 

## Parameters

Just like we use variables to define unknowns in systems of equations, in statistical inference we define _parameters_ to define unknown parts of our models. In the urn model which we are using to mimic an opinion poll, we do not know the proportion of blue beads in the urn. We define the parameters $p$ to represent this quantity. $p$ is the average of the urn because if we take the average of the 1s (blue) and 0s (red), we get the proportion of blue beads. Since our main goal is figuring out what is $p$, we are going to _estimate this parameter_. 

The ideas presented here on how we estimate parameters and provide insights into how good these estimates are, extrapolate to many data science tasks. For example, we may want to determine the difference in health improvement between patients receiving treatment and a control group. We may ask what are the health effects of smoking on a population? What are the differences in racial groups of fatal shootings by police? What is the rate of change in life expectancy in the US during the last 10 years? All these questions can be framed as a task of estimating a parameter from a sample.

## Polling versus forecasting

Before we continue, let's make an important clarification related to the practical problem of forecasting the election. If a poll is conducted four months before the election, it is estimating the $p$ for that moment and not for election day. The $p$ for election night might be different since people's opinions fluctuate through time. The polls provided the night before the election tend to be the most accurate since opinions don't change that much in a day. However, forecasters try to build tools that model how opinions vary across time and try to predict the election night results taking into consideration the fact that opinions fluctuate. We will describe some approaches for doing this in our a later section. 

## Properties of our estimate: expected value and standard error 

To understand how good our estimate is, we will describe the statistical properties of the random variable defined above: the sample proportion $\bar{X}$. Remember that $\bar{X}$ is the sum of independent draws so the rules we covered in the probability chapter apply.

Using what we have learned, the expected value of the sum $N\bar{X}$ is $N \times$ the average of the urn, $p$. So dividing by the non-random constant $N$ gives us that the expected value of the average $\bar{X}$ is $p$. We can write it using our mathematical notation:

$$
\mbox{E}(\bar{X}) = p
$$

We can also use what we learned to figure out the standard error: the standard error of the sum is $\sqrt{N} \times$ the standard deviation of the urn. Can we compute the standard error of the urn? We learned a formula that tells us that it is $(1-0) \sqrt{p (1-p)}$ = $\sqrt{p (1-p)}$. Because we are dividing the sum by $N$, we arrive at the following formula for the standard error for the average:

$$
\mbox{SE}(\bar{X}) = \sqrt{p(1-p)/N}
$$

This result reveals the power of polls. The expected value of the sample proportion $\bar{X}$ is the parameter of interest $p$ and we can make the standard error as small as we want by increasing $N$. The law of large numbers tells us that with a large enough poll, our estimate converges to $p$.

If we take a large enough poll to make our standard error about 1%, we will be quite certain about who will win. But how large does the poll have to be for the standard error to be this small? 

One problem is that we do not know $p$, so we can't compute the standard error. For illustrative purposes, let's assume that $p=0.51$ and make a plot of the standard error versus the sample size $N$: 

```{r standard-error-versus-sample-size, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p <- 0.51
N <- 10^seq(1,5, len=100)
data.frame(N=N, SE = sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)) %>% ggplot(aes(N, SE)) + geom_line() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(10,100,1000,10000), trans = "log10")
```

From the plot we see that we would need a poll of over 10,000 people to get the standard error that low. We rarely see polls of this size due in part to costs. From the Real Clear Politics table, we learn that the sample sizes in opinion polls range from 500-3,500 people. For a sample size of 1,000 and $p=0.51$, the standard error is:
```{r}
sqrt(p*(1-p))/sqrt(1000)
```

or 1.5 percentage points. So even with large polls, for close elections, $\bar{X}$ can lead us astray if we don't realize it is a random variable. Nonetheless, we can actually say more about how close we get the $p$.

## Exercises {-}

1. Suppose you poll a population in which a proportion $p$ of voters are Democrats and $1-p$ are Republicans. Your sample size is $N=25$. Consider the random variable $S$ which is the **total** number of Democrats in your sample. What is the expected value of this random variable? Hint: it's a function of $p$.


2. What is the standard error of $S$ ? Hint: it's a function of $p$.

3. Consider the random variable $S/N$. This is equivalent to the sample average, which we have been denoting as $\bar{X}$. What is the expected value of the $\bar{X}$? Hint: it's a function of $p$.

4. What is the standard error of $\bar{X}$? Hint: it's a function of $p$.

5. Write a line of code that gives you the standard error `se` for the problem above for `p <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)`. Make a plot of `se` versus `p`. 


6. Copy the code above and put it inside a for-loop to make the plot for $N=25$, $N=100$ and $N=1000$. 


7. If we are interested in the difference in proportions, $p - (1-p)$, our estimate is $d = \bar{X} - (1-\bar{X})$. Use the rules we learned about sums of random variables and scaled random variables to derive the expected value of $d$.


8. What is the standard error of $d$?


9. If the actual $p=.45$, it means the Republicans are winning by a relatively large margin since $d= -.1$, which is a 10% margin of victory. What is the standard error of $2\hat{X}-1$ in this case? 


10. Given the answer to 9, which of the following best describes your strategy of using a sample size of $N=25$?

    A. The expected value of our estimate $2\bar{X}-1$ is $d$, so our prediction will be right on.
    
    B. Our standard error is larger than the difference, so the chances of $2\bar{X}-1$ being positive and throwing us off were not that small. We should pick a larger sample size.
    
    C. The difference is 10% and the standard error is about 0.2, therefore much smaller than the difference.
    
    D. Because we don't know $p$, we have no way knowing that making $N$ larger would actually improve our standard error.
