# Cross validation

In a previous chapter, we described that a common goal of machine learning is to find an algorithm that produces predictors $\hat{Y}$ for an outcome $Y$ that minimizes the MSE:

$$
\mbox{MSE} = \mbox{E}\left\{ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{Y}_i - Y_i)^2 \right\}
$$
When all we have at our disposal is one dataset, we can estimate the MSE with the observed MSE like this:

$$
\hat{\mbox{MSE}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
$$
These two are often referred to as the _true error_ and _apparent error_ respectively.

There are two important characteristics of the apparent error we should always keep in mind:

1. Because our data is random, the apparent error is a random variable. For example, the dataset we have may be a random sample from a larger population. So an algorithm having a lower apparent error than another algorithm, may be due to luck.

2. If we train an algorithm on the same dataset that we use to compute the apparent error, we might be overtraining. In general, when we do this, the apparent error will be an underestimate of the true error. We saw an extreme example of this with k nearest neighbor.

Cross validation is a technique that permits us to alleviate both these problems. To understand cross validation, it helps to think of the true error, a theoretical quantity, as the average of many apparent errors obtained by applying the algorithm to $B$ new random samples of the data, none of them used to train the algorithm. As shown in a previous chapter, we think of the true error as:


$$
\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \left(\hat{y}_i^b - y_i^b\right)^2 
$$
with $B$ a large number that can be thought of as practically infinite. 
As already mentioned, this is a theoretical quantity because we only have available one set of outcomes: $y_1, \dots, y_n$. Cross validation is based on the idea of imitating the theoretical setup above as best we can with the data we have. To do this, we have to generate a series of different random samples. There are several approaches we can use. But the general idea for all of them is to randomly generate smaller datasets that are not used for training, and instead used to estimate the true error.

## K-fold cross validation

The first one we describe is _K-fold cross validation_. 
Generally speaking, a machine learning challenge starts with a dataset (blue in the image below). We need to build an algorithm using this dataset that will eventually be used in completely independent datasets (yellow).

```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = "500px", out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("ml/img/cv-1.png")
```

But we don't get to see these independent datasets. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = "500px", out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("ml/img/cv-2.png")
```

So to imitate this situation, we carve out a piece of our dataset and pretend it is an independent dataset: we divide the dataset into a _training set_ (blue) and a _test set_ (red). We will train our algorithm exclusively on the training set and use the test set only for evaluation purposes.

We usually try to select a small piece of the dataset so that we have as much data as possible to train. However, we also want the test set to be large so that we obtain a stable estimate of the loss. Typical choices are to use 10%-20% of the data for testing. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = "500px", out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("ml/img/cv-3.png")
```

Let's reiterate that it is indispensable that we not use the test set at all: not for filtering out rows, not for selecting features, nothing! 

Now this presents a new problem because for most machine learning algorithms we need to select parameters, for example the number of neighbors $k$ in k-nearest neighbors. Here, we will refer to the set of parameters as $\lambda$. We need to optimize algorithm parameters without using our test set and we know that if we optimize and evaluate on the same dataset, we will overtrain.  This is where cross validation is most useful.

For each set of algorithm parameters being considered, we we want an estimate of the MSE and then we will chose the parameters with the smallest MSE. Cross validation provides this estimate.

First, before we start the cross validation procedure, it is important to fix all the algorithm parameters. Although we will train the algorithm on the set of training sets, the parameters $\lambda$ will be the same across all training sets. We will use $\hat{y}_i(\lambda)$ to denote the predictors obtained when we use parameters $\lambda$.

So, if we are going to imitate this definition:


$$
\mbox{MSE}(\lambda) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \left(\hat{y}_i^b(\lambda) - y_i^b\right)^2 
$$

we want to consider datasets that can be thought of as an independent random sample and we want to do this several times. With K-fold cross validation, we do it $K$ times. In the cartoons, we are showing an example that uses $K=5$. 

We will eventually end up with $K$ samples, but let's start by describing how to construct the first: we simply pick $M=N/K$ (we round if $M$ is not a round number) observations at random and think of these as a random sample $y_1^b, \dots, y_M^b$, with $b=1$. We call this the validation set:


```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = "500px", out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("ml/img/cv-4.png")
```

Now we can fit the model in the training set, then compute the apparent error on the independent set:

$$
\hat{\mbox{MSE}}_b(\lambda) = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M \left(\hat{y}_i^b(\lambda) - y_i^b\right)^2 
$$

Note that this is just one sample and will therefore return a noisy estimate of the true error. This is why we take $K$ samples, not just one. In K-cross validation, we randomly split the observations into $K$ non-overlapping sets:


```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = "500px", out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("ml/img/cv-5.png")
```


Now we repeat the calculation above for each of these sets $b=1,\dots,K$ and obtain $\hat{\mbox{MSE}}_1(\lambda),\dots, \hat{\mbox{MSE}}_K(\lambda)$. Then, for our final estimate, we compute the average:

$$
\hat{\mbox{MSE}}(\lambda) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^K \hat{\mbox{MSE}}_b(\lambda)
$$

and obtain an estimate of our loss. A final step would be to select the $\lambda$ that minimizes the MSE.

We have described how to use cross validation to optimize parameters. However, we now have to take into account the fact that the optimization occurred on the training data and therefore we need an estimate of our final algorithm based on data that was not used to optimize the choice. Here is where we use the test set we separated early on:


```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = "500px", out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("ml/img/cv-6.png")
```

We can do cross validation again:

```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = "500px", out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("ml/img/cv-7.png")
```

and obtain a final estimate of our expected loss. However, note that this means that our entire compute time gets multiplied by $K$. You will soon learn that performing this task takes time because we are performing many complex computations. As a result, we are always looking for ways to reduce this time. For the final evaluation, we often just use the one test set.

Once we are satisfied with this model and want to make it available to others, we could refit the model on the entire dataset, without changing the parameters.


```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = "500px", out.extra='style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: #000; padding:3px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("ml/img/cv-7.png")
```


Now how do we pick the cross validation $K$? Large values of $K$ are preferable because the training data better imitates the original dataset. However, larger values of $K$ will have much slower computation time: for example, 100-fold cross validation will be 10 times slower than 10-fold cross validation. For this reason, the choices of $K=5$ and $K=10$ are popular.

One way we can improve the variance of our final estimate is to take more samples. To do this, we would no longer require the training set to be partitioned into non-overlapping sets. Instead, we would just pick $K$ sets of some size at random.

One popular version of this technique, at each fold, picks observations at random with replacement (which means the same observation can appear twice). This approach has some advantages (not discussed here) and is generally referred to as the _Bootstrap_. In fact, this is the default approach in the __caret__ package.  Below we include an explanation of how it works in general.


## Exercises {-}

Generate a set of random predictors and outcomes like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(1996)
n <- 1000
p <- 10000
x <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), n, p)
colnames(x) <- paste("x", 1:ncol(x), sep = "_")
y <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5) %>% factor()

x_subset <- x[ ,sample(p, 100)]
```

1. Because `x` and `y` are completely independent, you should not be able to predict `y` using `x` with accuracy larger than 0.5. Confirm this by running cross-validation using logistic regression to fit the model. Because we have so many predictors, we selected a random sample `x_subset`. Use the subset when training the model. Hint: use the caret `train` function. The `results` component of the output of `train` shows you the accuracy. Ignore the warnings.


2. Now, instead of a random selection of predictors, we are going to search for those that are most predictive of the outcome. We can do this by comparing the values for the $y=1$ group to those in the $y=0$ group, for each predictor, using a t-test. You can perform this step like this:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    devtools::install_bioc("genefilter")
    install.packages("genefilter")
    library(genefilter)
    tt <- colttests(x, y)
    ```
    
    Create a vector of the p-values and call it `pvals`.


3. Create an index `ind` with the column numbers of the predictors that were "statistically significantly" associated with `y`. Use a p-value cutoff of 0.01 to define "statistically significant". How many predictors survive this cutoff?


4. Re-run the cross-validation but after redefining `x_subset` to be the subset of `x` defined by the columns showing "statistically significant" association with `y`. What is the accuracy now?


5. Re-run the cross-validation again, but this time using kNN. Try out the following grid `k = seq(101, 301, 25)` of tuning parameters. Make a plot of the resulting accuracies.

6. In exercise 3 and 4, we see that despite the fact that `x` and `y` are completely independent, we were able to predict `y` with accuracy higher than 70%. We must be doing something wrong then. What is it?

    A. The function `train` estimates accuracy on the same data it uses to train the algorithm.
    B. We are over-fitting the model by including 100 predictors.
    C. We used the entire dataset to select the columns used in the model. This step needs to be included as part of the algorithm. The cross-validation was done    **after** this selection.
    D. The high accuracy is just due to random variability.

7. Advanced. Re-do the cross validation but this time include the selection step in the cross-validation. The accuracy should now be close to 50%.

    
8. Use the `train` function to predict tissue from gene expression in the `tissue_gene_expression` dataset. Use kNN. What `k` works best?
 


## Bootstrap

Suppose the income distribution of your population is as follows:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
n <- 10^6
income <- 10^(rnorm(n, 4.656786, 0.4394738))
```

```{r income-distribution}
hist(log10(income))
```

The population median is: 

```{r}
m <- median(income)
m
```

Suppose we don't have access to the entire population, but want to estimate the median $m$. We take a sample of 250 and estimate the population median $m$ with the sample median $M$:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
N <- 250
X <- sample(income, N)
M <- median(X)
M
```

Can we construct a confidence interval? What is the distribution of $M$ ?

From a Monte Carlo simulation, we see that the distribution of $M$ is approximately normal with the following expected value and standard error:

```{r median-is-normal}
B <- 10^5
Ms <- replicate(B, {
  X <- sample(income, N)
  M <- median(X)
})
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(Ms)
qqnorm(Ms)
qqline(Ms)
mean(Ms)
sd(Ms)
```

The problem here is that, as we have already described, in practice we do not have access to the distribution. In the past, we have used the central limit theorem. But the CLT we studied applies to averages and here we are interested in the median. 

The Bootstrap permits us to approximate a Monte Carlo simulation without access to the entire distribution. The general idea is relatively simple. We act as if the observed sample is the population. We then sample (with replacement) datasets, of the same sample size as the original dataset. Then we compute the summary statistic, in this case median, on this _bootstrap sample_. 

Theory tells us that, in many situations, the distribution of the statistics obtained with bootstrap samples approximate the distribution of our actual statistic. This is how we construct bootstrap samples and an approximate distribution:


```{r}
B <- 10^5
M_stars <- replicate(B, {
  X_star <- sample(X, N, replace = TRUE)
  M_star <- median(X_star)
})
```

Now we can check how close it is to the actual distribution:

```{r boostram-versus-monte-carlo}
qqplot(Ms, M_stars)
abline(0,1)  
```

We see it is not perfect, but it provides a decent approximation:

```{r}
quantile(Ms, c(0.05, 0.95))
quantile(M_stars, c(0.05, 0.95))
```

This is much better than what we get if we mindlessly use the CLT:

```{r}
median(X) + 1.96 * sd(X)/sqrt(N) * c(-1,1)
```


If we know the distribution is normal, we can use the bootstrap to estimate the mean:

```{r}
mean(Ms) + 1.96*sd(Ms)*c(-1,1)
mean(M_stars) + 1.96*sd(M_stars)*c(-1,1)
```

**Note that we can use ideas similar to those used in the Bootstrap in cross validaion: instead of dividing the data into equal partitions, we simply Boostrap many times.**





## Exercises {-}

1. The `createResample` function can be used to create bootstrap samples. So, for example, we can create 10 bootstrap samples for the `mnist_27` dataset like this:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    set.seed(1995)
    indexes <- createResample(mnist_27$train$y, 10)
    ```
    
    How many times do `3`, `4` and `7` appear in the first re-sampled index?

    
2. We see that some numbers appear more than once and others appear no times. This has to be this way for each dataset to be independent. Repeat the exercise for all the re-sampled indexes.

    
3. Generate a random dataset like this:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    y <- rnorm(100, 0, 1)
    ```

    Estimate the 75th quantiles, which we know is: 


    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    qnorm(0.75)
    ```

    with the sample quantile:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    quantile(y, 0.75)
    ```

    Run a Monte Carlo simulation to learn the expected value and standard error of this random variable.

    
4. In practice, we can't run a Monte Carlo simulation because we don't know if `rnorm` is being used to simulate the data. Use the bootstrap to estimate the standard error using just the initial sample `y`. Use 10 bootstrap samples.

    

5. Redo exercise 4, but with 10,000 bootstrap samples.
