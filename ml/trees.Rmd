# Trees and Random Forests

## The curse of dimensionality

We described how methods such as LDA and QDA are not meant to be used with many predictors $p$ because the number of parameters that we need to estimate becomes too large. For example, with the digits example $p=784$, so we would have over 600,000 parameters with LDA and we would multiply that by the number of classes for QDA. Kernel methods such as kNN or local regression do not have model parameters to estimate. However, they also face a challenge when multiple predictors are used due to what is referred to the _curse of dimensionality_. The _dimension_ here refers to the fact that when we have $p$ predictors, the distance between two observations is computed in $p$-dimensional space.

A useful way of understanding the curse of dimensionality is by considering how large we have to make a span/neighborhood/window to include a given percentage of the data. Remember that with larger neighborhoods, our methods lose flexibility. 

For example, suppose we have one continuous predictor with equally spaced points in the [0,1] interval and we want to create windows that include 1/10-th of data. Then it's easy to see that our windows have to be of size 0.1:

```{r curse-of-dim-1, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=1}
rafalib::mypar()
x <- seq(0,1,len=100)
y <- rep(1, 100)
plot(x,y, xlab="",ylab="", cex=0.25, yaxt="n", xaxt="n",type="n")
lines(x[c(15,35)], y[c(15,35)], col="blue",lwd=3)
points(x,y, cex = 0.25)
points(x[25],y[25],col="blue", cex = 0.5, pch=4)
text(x[c(15,35)], y[c(15,35)], c("[","]"))
```

Now, for two predictors, if we decide to keep the neighborhood just as small, 10% for each dimension, we include only 1 point:

```{r curse-of-dim-2, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5}
tmp <- expand.grid(1:10,1:10)
x <- tmp[,1]
y <- tmp[,2]
rafalib::mypar()
plot(x,y, xlab="",ylab="", cex=0.25, yaxt="n", xaxt="n",type="n")
polygon(c(x[25]-0.5, x[25]-0.5, x[25]+0.5, x[25]+0.5),
        c(y[25]-0.5, y[25]+0.5, y[25]+0.5, y[25]-0.5), col="blue")
points(x,y, cex = 0.25)
points(x[25],y[25], cex = 0.5, pch=4)
```

If we want to include 10% of the data, then we need to increase the size of each side of the square to $\sqrt{10} \approx .316$:

```{r curse-of-dim-3, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5}
rafalib::mypar()
plot(x,y, xlab="",ylab="", cex=0.25, yaxt="n", xaxt="n",type="n")
polygon(c(x[25]-sqrt(10)/2, x[25]-sqrt(10)/2, x[25]+sqrt(10)/2, x[25]+sqrt(10)/2),
        c(y[25]-sqrt(10)/2, y[25]+sqrt(10)/2, y[25]+sqrt(10)/2, y[25]-sqrt(10)/2),
        col="blue")
points(x,y, cex = 0.25)
points(x[25],y[25], cex = 0.5, pch=4)
```

Using the same logic, if we want to include 10% of the data in a three dimensional space, then the side of each cube is  $\sqrt[3]{10} \approx 4.64$.
In general, to include 10% of the data in a case with $p$ dimensions, we need an interval with each side of size $\sqrt[p]{.10}$ of the total. This proportion gets close to 1 (including all the data and no longer smoothing) quickly:

```{r curse-of-dim-4}
p <- 1:100
qplot(p, .1^(1/p), ylim = c(0,1))
```

So by the time we reach 100 predictors, the neighborhood is no longer very local, as each side covers almost the entire dataset.

Here we look at a set of elegant and versatile methods that adapt to higher dimensions and also allow these regions to take more complex shapes while still producing models that are interpretable. These are very popular, well-known and studied methods. We will concentrate on Regression and Decision Trees and their extension to Random Forests.


## Classification and Regression Trees (CART)

To motivate this section, we will use a new dataset 
that includes the breakdown of the composition of olive oil into 8 fatty acids:

```{r}
data("olive")
head(olive)
names(olive)
```

For illustrative purposes, we will try to predict the region using the fatty acid composition values as predictors.

```{r}
table(olive$region)
```

We remove the `area` column because we won't use it as a predictor.

```{r}
olive <- select(olive, -area)
```

Let's very quickly try to predict the region using kNN:

```{r olive-knn}
library(caret)
fit <- train(region ~ .,  method = "knn", 
             tuneGrid = data.frame(k = seq(1, 15, 2)), 
             data = olive)
ggplot(fit)
```

We see that using just one neighbor, we can predict relatively well. However, a bit of data exploration reveals that we should be able to do even better. For example, if we look at the distribution of each predictor stratified by region:

```{r olive-eda, out.width="100%"}
olive %>% gather(fatty_acid, percentage, -region) %>%
  ggplot(aes(region, percentage, fill = region)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~fatty_acid, scales = "free")
```

We see that eicosenoic is only present in Southern Italy and that linolenic separates Northern Italy from Sardinia. This implies that we should be able to build an algorithm that predicts perfectly! We can see this clearly by plotting the values for these two predictors:

```{r olive-two-predictors}
p <- olive %>% 
  ggplot(aes(eicosenoic, linoleic, color = region)) + 
  geom_point()
p
```

We can, by eye, construct a prediction rule that partitions the predictor space like this:

```{r olive-separated}
p + geom_vline(xintercept = 0.065, lty = 2) + 
  geom_segment(x = -0.2, y = 10.535, xend = 0.065, yend = 10.535, color = "black", lty = 2)
```

Specifically, we define the following decision rule. If eicosenoic is larger than 0.065, predict Southern Italy. If not, then if linolenic is larger than $10.535$, predict Sardinia and if lower, predict Northern Italy. We can draw this decision tree like this:

```{r olive-tree, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4.5}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
train_rpart <- train(region ~ .,
      method = "rpart",
      data = olive)

plot(train_rpart$finalModel, margin = 0.1)
text(train_rpart$finalModel, cex = 0.75)
```

Decision trees like this are often used in practice. For example, to decide if a person is at risk of having a heart attack, doctors use the following:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# source https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Walton/publication/228297479/figure/fig1/AS:301828123185152@1448972840090/Decision-Tree-for-Heart-Attack-Victim-adapted-from-Gigerenzer-et-al-1999-4.png

```
(Source: [Walton 2010 Informal Logic, Vol. 30, No. 2, pp. 159-184](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1759289_code1486039.pdf?abstractid=1759289&mirid=1&type=2))

The general idea of the methods we are describing is to define an algorithm that uses data to create these trees. 

Regression and decision trees operate by predicting an outcome variable $Y$ by partitioning predictor space.


## Regression tree

When the outcome is continuous, we call this method _regression_ trees. We will use a continuous case, the 2008 poll data introduced earlier, to describe the basic idea of how we build these algorithms. We will try to estimate the conditional expectation $f(x) = \mbox{E}(Y | X = x)$ with $Y$ the poll margin and $x$ the day. 

```{r polls-2008-again}
data("polls_2008")
qplot(day, margin, data = polls_2008)
```

The general idea here is to build a decision tree and, at end of each _node_, we will have a different prediction $\hat{Y}$. The regression tree model then:

1. Partitions feature space into $J$ non-overlapping regions, $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_J$.
2. For every observation that falls within region $x \in R_j$, predict with the average of the training observations $Y_i$ in the region: $x_i \in R_j$.

But how do we decide on the partition  $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_M$ and how do we choose $M$?

Regression trees create partitions recursively. So suppose we already have a partition. We then have to decide what predictor $j$ to use to make the next partition and where to make it. 

Imagine then that we already have a partition so that every observation $i$ is in exactly one of these partitions. For each of these partitions, we will divide further using the algorithm described below.

Find predictor $j$ and value $s$ that define two new partitions $R_1(j,s)$ and $R_2(j,s)$ that split our observations into: 

$$
R_1(j,s) = \{\mathbf{X} \mid X_j < s\} \mbox{  and  } R_2(j,s) = \{\mathbf{X} \mid X_j \geq s\}
$$

and then define $\bar{y}_{R_1}$ and $\bar{y}_{R_2}$ as the averages of the observations in both those partitions. Now we find the predictor $j$ and split location $s$ that minimizes the residual sum of square (RSS):
$$
\sum_{i:\, x_i \in R_1(j,s)} (y_i - \hat{y}_{R_1})^2 +
\sum_{i:\, x_i \in R_2(j,s)} (y_i - \hat{y}_{R_2})^2
$$


This is then applied recursively to the new regions $R_1$ and $R_2$. Once we are done partitioning the predictor space into regions, in each region a prediction is made using the observations in that region. 

Let's take a look at what this algorithm does on the 2008 presidential election poll data. We will use the `rpart` function in the __rpart__ package.

```{r}
fit <- rpart(margin ~ ., data = polls_2008)
```

Here. there is only one predictor. So we do not have to decide which predictor $j$ to split by. We simply have to decide what value $s$ we use to split. We can visually see where the splits were made:


```{r polls-2008-tree, fig.height=4.5, out.width="100%"}
plot(fit, margin = 0.1)
text(fit, cex = 0.75)
```

The first split is made on day 39.5. One of those regions is then split at day 86.5. The two resulting new partitions are split on days 49.5 and 117.5 respectively, and so on. We end up with 8 partitions. The final estimate $\hat{f}(x)$ looks like this:

```{r polls-2008-tree-fit }
polls_2008 %>% 
  mutate(y_hat = predict(fit)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(day, margin)) +
  geom_step(aes(day, y_hat), col="red")
```

Now why did the algorithm stop partitioning at 8? There are some details of the algorithm we did not explain above. 

1. **Complexity parameter**:
Every time we split and define two new partitions, our training set RSS decreases. This is because with more partitions, our model has flexibility to adapt to the training data. In fact, if you split until every point is its own partition, then RSS goes all the way down to 0 since the average of one value is that same value. To avoid this, the algorithm sets a minimum for how much the RSS must improve for another partition to be added. This parameter is referred to as the _complexity parameter_ (cp). The RSS must improve by a factor of cp for the new partition to be added. 

2. `minsplit`: The algorithm sets a minimum number of observations to be partitioned. The default is 20. 

3. `minbucket`: The algorithm also sets a minimum on the number of observations in each partition. If the optimal split results in a partition with less observations than this minimum, it is not considered. The default is `round(minsplit/3)`

As expected, if we set `cp = 0` and `minsplit=2`, then our prediction is our original data:

```{r polls-2008-tree-over-fit}
fit <- rpart(margin ~ ., data = polls_2008, control = rpart.control(cp = 0, minsplit = 2))
polls_2008 %>% 
  mutate(y_hat = predict(fit)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(day, margin)) +
  geom_step(aes(day, y_hat), col="red")
```

Note that we can _prune_ tree by _snipping of_ partitions that do not meet a `cp` criterion:

```{r polls-2008-prune}
pruned_fit <- prune(fit, cp = 0.01)
polls_2008 %>% 
  mutate(y_hat = predict(pruned_fit)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(day, margin)) +
  geom_step(aes(day, y_hat), col="red")
```

So how do we pick `cp`? We can use cross validation just like with any tuning parameter.

```{r polls-2008-tree-train}
library(caret)
train_rpart <- train(margin ~ ., 
                     method = "rpart",
                     tuneGrid = data.frame(cp = seq(0, 0.05, len = 25)),
                     data = polls_2008)
ggplot(train_rpart)
```

To see the resulting tree, we access the `finalModel` and plot it:



```{r polls-2008-final-tree, fig.height=4.5, out.width="100%"}
plot(train_rpart$finalModel, margin = 0.1)
text(train_rpart$finalModel, cex = 0.75)
```


And because we only have one predictor, we can actually plot $\hat{f}(x)$:

```{r polls-2008-final-fit}
polls_2008 %>% 
  mutate(y_hat = predict(train_rpart)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(day, margin)) +
  geom_step(aes(day, y_hat), col="red")
```


## Classification (decision) trees

Classification, or decision trees, are used in classification problems where the outcome is categorical. We use the same partitioning principle with some differences to account for the fact that we are now working with categorical data. 

The first difference is that rather than taking the average in each partition, we predict with whatever class is the most common among the training set observations within the partition.

The second is that we can no longer use RSS to decide on the partition. While we could use a naive approach of looking for partitions that minimize training error, better performing approaches use more sophisticated metrics. Two of the more popular ones are the _Gini Index_ and _Entropy_.  If we define $\hat{p}_{m,k}$ as the proportion of observations in partition $m$ that are of class $k$, then the  _Gini Index_ is defined as:

$$
\mbox{Gini} = \sum_{k=1}^K \hat{p}_{m,k}(1-\hat{p}_{m,k})
$$

and  **Entropy** is defined as: 

$$
\mbox{Entropy} = -\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{p}_{m,k}\log(\hat{p}_{m,k}), \mbox{ with } 0 \times \log(0) \mbox{ defined as }0
$$

Both of these seek to partition observations into subsets that have the same class. Note that if a partition has only one class, say the first one, then $\hat{p}{m,1} = 1, \hat{p}{m,2} = 0, \dots, \hat{p}{m,K} = 0$ and both the Gini Index and Entropy are 0.

Let us look at how a classification tree performs on the digits example we examined before:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data("mnist_27")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot_cond_prob <- function(p_hat=NULL){
  tmp <- mnist_27$true_p
  if(!is.null(p_hat)){
    tmp <- mutate(tmp, p=p_hat)
  }
  tmp %>% ggplot(aes(x_1, x_2, z=p, fill=p)) +
  geom_raster(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors=c("#F8766D","white","#00BFC4")) +
  stat_contour(breaks=c(0.5),color="black")
}
```


```{r mnist-27-tree, echo = FALSE}
train_rpart <- train(y ~ .,
                     method = "rpart",
                     tuneGrid = data.frame(cp = seq(0.0, 0.1, len = 25)),
                     data = mnist_27$train)
plot(train_rpart)
```

We can see that the accuracy is better than regression, but is not as good as the kernel methods:

```{r}
confusionMatrix(predict(train_rpart, mnist_27$test), mnist_27$test$y)$overall["Accuracy"]
```

The plot of the estimate conditional probability shows us the limitations of classification trees:

```{r rf-cond-prob, echo=FALSE}
plot_cond_prob(predict(train_rpart, mnist_27$true_p, type = "prob")[,2])
```


With decision trees, the boundary can't be smooth.

Classification trees have certain advantages that make them very useful. They are highly interpretable, even more so than linear model. They are easy to visualize (if small enough).  Finally, they (maybe) model human decision processes and don't require that dummy predictors for categorical variables be used.

On the other hand, the approach via recursive partitioning can easily over-train and 
is therefore a bit harder to train than, for example, linear regression or kNN. It may not always be the best performing method since it is not very flexible and is highly unstable to changes in training data. Random Forests, explained next, improve on several of these shortcomings.


## Random Forests

Random Forests are a **very popular** approach that address the shortcomings of decision trees using a clever idea. The goal is to improve prediction performance and reduce instability by _averaging_ multiple decision trees (a forest of trees constructed with randomness). It has two features that help accomplish this.

The first trick is _bootstrap aggregation_ or _bagging_. The general  scheme for bagging is as follows:
  1. Build many decision trees $T_1, T_2, \dots, T_B$ using the  training set. We later explain how we assure they are different.
  2. For every observation in the test set, form a prediction $\hat{y}_j$ using tree $T_j$.
  3. For continuous outcomes, predict with $\hat{y} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{j=1}^B \hat{y}_j$. For categorical data  classification, predict $\hat{y}$ with majority vote (most frequent class among $\hat{y}_1, \dots, \hat{y}_T$).
     
So how do we get many decision trees from a single training set?

For this, we use the _bootstrap_. To create $T_j, \, j=1,\ldots,B$ from training set of size $N$:

1. Create a bootstrap training set by sampling $N$ observations from the training set **with replacement**.
2. Build a decision tree from bootstrap training set.

Here is the Random Forest estimate of the 2008 polls data:

```{r polls-2008-rf, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(randomForest)
fit <- randomForest(margin~., data = polls_2008) 
```

We can see the algorithm improves as we added more trees:

```{r more-trees-better-fit}
plot(fit)
```
In this case, we see that by the time we get to 200 trees, the algorithm is not changing much. But note that more complex problems will require more trees to converge.

```{r polls-2008-rf-fit}
polls_2008 %>%
  mutate(y_hat = predict(fit, newdata = polls_2008)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(day, margin)) +
  geom_line(aes(day, y_hat), col="red")
```

The averaging is what permits estimates that are not step functions.
The following animation helps illustrate this procedure. In the animated figure you see each of $b=1,\dots,50$ bootstrap samples appear in order. For each one we see the tree that is fitted, and in blue we see the result of bagging the trees up to that point.

```{r rf-animation, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

Here is the Random Forest fit for our digits example based on two predictors:

```{r mnits-27-rf-fit}
library(randomForest)
train_rf <- randomForest(y ~ ., data=mnist_27$train)

confusionMatrix(predict(train_rf, mnist_27$test),
                mnist_27$test$y)$overall["Accuracy"]
```

Here is what the conditional probabilities look like:

```{r cond-prob-rf}
plot_cond_prob(predict(train_rf, mnist_27$true_p, type = "prob")[,2])
```

We can train the parameters of the Random Forest. Below, we use the __caret__ package to optimize over the minimum node size:

```{r, cache=TRUE}

We can control the "smoothness" of the Random Forest estimate in several ways. One is to limit the size of each node. We can require the number of points per node to be larger:


The second Random Forests feature is to use a random selection of features to split when deciding on partitions. Specifically, when building each tree $T_j$, at each recursive partition only consider a randomly selected subset of predictors to check for best split. A different random choice of predictors is made for each tree. This reduces correlation between trees in forest, thereby improving prediction accuracy. The argument for this tuning parameter in  `randomForrest` is `mtry`.

A disadvantage of Random Forests is that we lose interpretability. However, we can use the fact that a bootstrap sample was used to construct trees to measure _variable importance_ from the Random Forest. This measure counts how often a predictor is used in the individual trees. You can learn more about _variable importance_ in an advanced [machine learning book](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf). The __caret__ package includes the function `varImp` that extracts variable importnance from any model in which the calculation is implemented. We give an example on how we use variable importance in the next section.


## Exercises {-}

1. Create a simple dataset where the outcomes grows 0.75 units on average for every increase in a predictor. 

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    n <- 1000
    sigma <- 0.25
    x <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)
    y <- 0.75 * x + rnorm(n, 0, sigma)
    dat <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
    ```

    Use `rpart` to fit a regression tree and save the result to `fit`.


2. Plot the final tree so that you can see where the partitions occurred.


3. Make a scatter plot of `y` versus `x` along with the predicted values based on the fit.


4. Now run Random Forests instead of a regression tree using `randomForest` from the __randomForest__ package, and remake the scatterplot with the prediction line.


5. Use the function `plot` to see if the Random Forest has converged or if we need more trees.


6. It seems that the default values for the Random Forest result in an estimate that is too flexible (unsmooth). Re-run the Random Forest but this time with `nodesize` set at 50 and `maxnodes` set at 25. Remake the plot.

7. We see that this yields smoother results. Let's use the train function to help us pick these values. From the [caret description](https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html) of methods we see that we can't tune the `maxnodes` parameter or the `nodesize` argument with `randomForests`. So we will use the __Rborist__ package and tune the `minNode` argument. Use the `train` function to try values `minNode <- seq(5, 250, 25)`. See which value minimizes the estimated RMSE.


8. Make a scatterplot along with the prediction from the best fitted model.


9. Use the `rpart` function to fit a classification tree to the `tissue_gene_expression` dataset. Use the `train` function to estimate the accuracy. Try out `cp` values of `seq(0, 0.05, 0.01)`. Plot the accuracies to report the results of the best model.


10. Study the confusion matrix for the best fitting classification tree. What do you observe happening for placenta?


11. Notice that placentas are called endometriums more often than placenta. Note also that the number of placentas is just six, and that, by default, `rpart` requires 20 observations before splitting a node. So it is difficult to have a node in which placentas are the majority. Rerun the above analysis but this time permit `rpart` to split any node by using the argument `control = rpart.control(minsplit = 0)`. Does the accuracy increase? Look at the confusion matrix again.



12. Plot the tree from the best fitting model.


13. We can see that with just six genes, we are able to predict the tissue type. Now let's see if we can do even better with a Random Forest. Use the `train` function and the `rf` method to train a Random Forest. Try out values of `mtry` ranging from, at least, `seq(50, 200, 25)`. What `mtry` value maximizes accuracy? To permit small `nodesize` to grow as we did with the classification trees, use the following argument: `nodesize = 1`.  This will take several seconds to run. If you want to test it out, try using smaller values with `ntree`. Set the seed to 1990.


14. Use the function `varImp` on the output of `train` and save it to an object called `imp`. 


15. The `rpart` model we ran above produced a tree that used just six predictors. Extracting the predictor names is not straightforward, but can be done. If the output of the call to train was `fit_rpart`, we can extract the names like this:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    ind <- !(fit_rpart$finalModel$frame$var == "<leaf>")
    tree_terms <- 
      fit_rpart$finalModel$frame$var[ind] %>%
      unique() %>%
      as.character()
    tree_terms
    ```

    What is the variable importance in the Random Forest call for these predictors? Where do they rank?


16. Advanced: Extract the top 50 predictors based on importance, take a subset of `x` with just these predictors and apply the function `heatmap` to see how these genes behave across the tissues. We will introduce the `heatmap` function in the Cluster Chapter.


17. In this chapter, we illustrated a couple of machine learning algorithms on a subset of the MNIST dataset. Try fitting a model to the entire dataset.
