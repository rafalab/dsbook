## Why use Git and GitHub?

There are three main reasons to use Git and GitHub.

1. Share: Even if we do not take advantage of the advanced and powerful version control functionality, we can still use Git and GitHub to share our code. We have already shown how we can do this with RStudio. 

2. Collaborating: Once you set up a central repo, you can have multiple people make changes to code and keep versions synched. GitHub provides a free service for centralized repos. GitHub also has a special utility, called a _pull request_, that can be used by anybody to suggest changes to your code. You can easily either accept or deny the request.

3. Version control: The version control capabilities of Git permit us to keep track of changes we make to our code. We can also revert back to previous versions of files. Git also permits us to create _branches_ in which we can test out ideas, then decide if we _merge_ the new branch with the original.

Here we focus on the sharing aspects of Git and GitHub and refer the reader to the links above to learn more about this powerful tool.

## Overview of Git

To effectively permit version control and collaboration in Git, files move across four different areas: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("productivity/img/git/git-layout.png") 
```

But how does it all get started? There are two ways. We can clone an existing repo or initialize one. We will explore cloning first.
 
### Clone

We are going to _clone_ an existing _Upstream Repository_. You can see it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rairizarry/murders). By visiting this page, you can see multiple files and directories. This is the Upstream Repository. By clicking the green clone button, we can copy the repo's URL `https://github.com/rairizarry/murders.git`. 

But what does _clone_ mean? Rather than download all these files to your computer, we are going to actually copy the entire Git structure, which means we will add the files and directories to each of the three local stages: Working Directory, Staging Area, and Local Repository. When you clone, all three are exactly the same to start. 

You can quickly see an example of this by doing the following. Open a terminal and type:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
wd <- getwd() ##so we set back later. We are about to start switching dirs
if(file.exists("git-example")) unlink("git-example", recursive=TRUE, force = TRUE)
```


```{bash}
pwd
mkdir git-example
cd git-example
git clone https://github.com/rairizarry/murders.git
cd murders
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "git-example/murders")
```


You now have cloned a GitHub repo and have a working Git directory, with all the files, on your system.

```{bash}
ls
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("productivity/img/git/git-clone.png") 
```


The _Working Directory_ is the same as your Unix working directory. When you edit files using an editor such as RStudio, you change the files in this area and only in this area. Git can tell you how these files relate to the versions of the files in other areas with the command `git status`:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("productivity/img/git/git-status.png") 
```

If you check the status now, you will see that nothing has changed and you get the following message:

```{bash}
git status
```

Now we are going to make changes to these files. Eventually, we want these new version of the files to be tracked and synched with the upstream repo. But we don't want to keep track of every little change: we don't want to sync until we are sure these versions are final enough to share. For this reason, edits in the staging area are not kept by the version control system.

To demonstrate, we add a file to the staging area with the `git add` command. Below we create a file using the Unix `echo` command just as an example (in reality you would use RStudio):

```{bash}
echo "test" >> new-file.txt
```

We are also adding a temporary file that we do not want to track at all:

```{bash}
echo "temporary" >> tmp.txt
```

Now we can stage the file we eventually want to add to our repository:

```{bash}
git add new-file.txt
```

Notice what the status says now:

```{bash}
git status
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("productivity/img/git/git-add.png") 
```

Because `new-file.txt` is staged, the current version of the file will get added to the local repository next time we commit, which we do as follows:

```{bash}
git commit -m "adding a new file" 
```

We have now changed to local repo:

```{bash}
git status
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("productivity/img/git/git-commit.png") 
```

However, if we edit that file again, it changes only in the working directory. To add to the local repo, we need to stage it and commit the changes that are added to the local repo:

```{bash}
echo "adding a line" >> new-file.txt
git add new-file.txt
git commit -m "adding a new line to new-file"
git status
```

Note that this step is often unnecessary in our uses of Git. We can skip the staging part if we add the file name to the commit command like this:

```{bash}
echo "adding a second line" >> new-file.txt
git commit -m "minor change to new-file" new-file.txt
git status
```

We can keep track of all the changes we have made with: 

```{bash}
git log new-file.txt
```

To keep everything synched, the final step is to push the changes to the upstream repo. This is done with the `git push` command like this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git push
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = wd)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("productivity/img/git/git-push.png") 
```

However, in this particular example, you will not be able to do this because you do not have permission to edit the upstream repo. If this was your repo, you could.

If this is a collaborative project, the upstream repo may change and become different than our version. To update our local repository to be like the upstream repo, we use the command `fetch`:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git fetch
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("productivity/img/git/git-fetch.png") 
```


And then to make these copies to the staging and working directory areas, we use the command:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git merge
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("productivity/img/git/git-merge.png") 
```

However, we often just want to change both with one command. For this, we use: 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git pull
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("productivity/img/git/git-pull.png") 
```


We earlier learned how RStudio has buttons to do all this. The details provided here should help you understand what happens in the background.


## Initilazing a Git directory

Now let's learn the second way we can get started: by initializing a directory on our own computer rather than cloning.

We will show how we created the GitHub for our gun murders project. We first created a project on our computer so we already had all the files and directory ready. But we did not yet have a Git local repo or GitHub upstream repo.

We start by creating a new repo on our GitHub page:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[112]) 
```

We click on the _New_ button:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[113]) 
```

We called it _murders_ to match the name of the directory on our local system. But if you are doing this for another project, please choose an appropriate name.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[114]) 
```

We then get a series of instructions on how to get started. But we can instead use what we have learned. The main thing we need from this page is to copy the repo's URL, in this case: `https://github.com/rairizarry/murders.git`. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[115]) 
```

At this moment, we can start a terminal and `cd` into our local projects directory. In our example, it would be:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd ~/projects/murders
```

We then _intialize_ the directory. This turns the directory into Git directory and Git starts tracking:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git init
```

All the files are now **only** in our working directory. 

The next step is to connect the local repo with the GitHub repo. In a previous example, we had RStudio do this for us. Now we need to do it ourselves. We can by adding any of the files and committing it: 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add README.txt
git commit -m "First commit. Adding README.txt file just to get started"
```

We now have a file in our local repo and can connect it to the upstream repo, which has url: `https://github.com/rairizarry/murders.git`. 

To do this, we use the the command `git remote add`. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git remote add origin `https://github.com/rairizarry/murders.git`
```

We can now use `git push` since there is a connection to an upstream repo:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git push
```

We can continue adding and committing each file, but it might be easier to use RStudio. To do this, start the project by opening the Rproj file. The git icons should appear:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[119]) 
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[120]) 
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[121]) 
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[122]) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[123]) 
```

We can now go to GitHub and confirm that our files are there.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(screenshots[124]) 
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
if(file.exists("git-example")) unlink("git-example", recursive=TRUE, force = TRUE)
```
